# Cleanchain

In this digital age, blockchain technology has the power to gather, filter and trace digital informations in order to create the right trust through a secure and decentralised net.

A blockchain is a distributed database: a digital register that publicly stores encoded informations on the internet. It is a very powerful and versatile tool, able to be adapted for different solutions in different environments and our goal is to improve transparency and efficiency of the food chain industry through its use.

## Who we are

We are a 5-member team of university students and working professionals, currently working for the [Start For Future project](https://www.eiturbanmobility.eu/start-for-future/), organized by the European Institute of tecnology.

## Work in progress

This all thing is still in alpha stage but we are putting together all the pieces for a well made final cut. Stay tuned for further updates!
